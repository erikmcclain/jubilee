Jubilee was built to encapsulate all the best practices in hobbyist 3D printing machine design at the time.
As a result, it's a machine that takes inspiration from many many places.
Here's the (growing!) list of referenced projects and contributors

## Design Acknowledgments
* Nadya Peek of Machine Agency
  * for the time, expenses, and infrastructure that enabled Jubilee to come together over many iterations
* Eric Moyer
  * for continuous design feedback, manufacturing insights, and help with community engagement
* Sanjay Mortimer and the E3D Team
  * for an open reference for tool coupling
* J Steve White and Tony Akens of the [Railcore](https://railcore.org/) Project
  * for an incredibly well-documented BOM, an example of 3-point bed leveling firmware configs, a great example of community engagement, and openness in sharing and answering questions
* @marioquake on Github for suggesting a well-placed spacer
* @Ocho Camino on Discord for an improved Power Inlet Socket
* @Troll on Discord for a fantastic Logo on the bed plate rendering

## Manufacturing and Supplier Acknowledgements
* Matthew White at 713Maker
  * for supporting the Jubilee builder community with custom machined parts and developing the original magnetic bed plate
* Steve Wygant of SeeMeCNC
  * for supporting the Jubilee builder community with a generous variety of Jubilee's laser-cut and machined parts.
* Wade Wendorf at Mandala Rose Works
  * for supporting the Jubilee builder community with custom machined upgrade parts of various types
* Luke at Luke's Laboratory
  * for kit-izing various elements of the project, making them cheaper for Jubilee builders
* Rebecca and Jason of LDO Motors
